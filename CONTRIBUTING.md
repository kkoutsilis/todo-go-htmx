# Contributing to todo-go-htmx ðŸš€

Hey there! Thanks for checking out this little project. This project exists for learning, experimenting, and having fun with code, so jump right in!

## The Gist

This is a **learning playground**. Whether you're a complete beginner or a 10x dev, all contributions are welcome. Made a mistake? That's how we learn! Found a bug? Awesome, let's fix it together!

## How to Contribute

### Quick & Easy
- **Found a bug?** Open an issue and tell me what broke
- **Have an idea?** Share it in an issue. Wild ideas encouraged!
- **Want to fix something?** Fork it, fix it, PR it

### The Process
1. **Fork** this repo (hit that fork button!)
2. **Clone** your fork to your machine
3. **Create a branch** with a fun name like `fix-that-annoying-bug` or `add-rainbow-todos`
4. **Make your changes** go wild, experiment, break things, fix them
5. **Commit** with a message that makes sense (or at least tries to)
6. **Push** to your fork
7. **Open a PR** describe what you did and why

## What am I Looking For

**Literally anything!**

## Guidelines (The Friendly Kind)

- **Be kind** we're all learning here
- **Experiment freely** this isn't production code, so try new things!
- **Don't worry about "perfect" code** working code that teaches something is better than no code
- **Ask questions** seriously, ask away
- **Have fun** if you're not enjoying it, you're doing it wrong

## Code Style

None existent

## Need Help?

- **Stuck on something?** Open an issue and ask
- **Not sure if your idea is good?** It probably is. Open an issue anyway
- **First time contributing?** This is a great place to start!

**Remember:** This repo exists to learn and experiment. There are no stupid questions, no contributions too small, and no ideas too wild. Let's build something cool together! ðŸŽ‰
